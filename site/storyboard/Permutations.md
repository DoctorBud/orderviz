## Sets, Orderings and Permutations

We're talking about sets.

We're talking about the algorithms, definitions or generators that ultimately specify the elements of the set.

We're talking about the *orderings* of a set that are induced by an algorithm, definition, or generator.


We can consider the case where there is an explicit *generator*, or whether the set is characterized by its *definition*. In both cases, there is an interpretative computation process in applying or understanding the generotor or definition.

### Element's uniquess vs Ordering's uniqueness

Basically, we assume that we are focused on Ordering, and that the element itself is irrelevant.


### The 2-swap ordering

This is a simple pairwise swap of the elements of $\mathrm{N}$.

$1,2,3,4\dots$ becomes $2,1,4,3\dots$

Using permutation syntax, we can consider

$$\left((1,2)(3,4)\dots\right)$$

or

$$
\left(
\begin{matrix}
1 2 3 4\\
2 1 4 3
\end{matrix}
\right)
$$
